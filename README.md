# 🦀 Rust Programming Language

Rust is a modern systems programming language focused on **performance, safety,
and concurrency**. It is designed to build fast, reliable, and memory-safe
applications without requiring a garbage collector.

Rust is widely used in:
- System programming
- Operating systems
- Security tools
- Blockchain
- Embedded systems
- High-performance applications

## 🎯 Purpose of Using Rust

Rust was created to solve common problems found in low-level languages like C and C++.

### Why Rust?

- **Memory Safety**  
  Prevents null pointer dereference, buffer overflow, and use-after-free at compile time.

- **High Performance**  
  Comparable to C/C++ with zero-cost abstractions.

- **No Garbage Collector**  
  Predictable performance and low-level control.

- **Concurrency Without Data Races**  
  Safe multi-threading enforced by the compiler.

- **Modern Tooling**  
  Comes with an excellent package manager and build system.

## 🧠 Key Rust Concepts

- Ownership and Borrowing
- Structs and Enums
- Pattern Matching (`match`)
- Strong Type System
- Explicit Error Handling (`Result`, `Option`)

## 🛠️ Cargo – Rust Build System

Cargo is Rust’s official:
- Package manager
- Build tool
- Dependency manager

With Cargo, you can:
- Create new projects
- Build code
- Run applications
- Manage dependencies
- Run tests
